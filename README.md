# Predicting-Hotel-Reservation-Cancellations-

**Introduction**

I have worked with the bookings_df data frame in this project. This data set contains information on over 5,000 reservations made at a U.S. hotel. The description of this data and the variables contained in it are provided below.

The objective of this project is to explore the factors that lead to customers canceling their hotel reservations and develop machine learning algorithms that will predict the likelihood of a customer canceling their reservation in the future.

**Problem Statement:**

The hotel's goal is to become better at identifying customers at risk of canceling their reservation.

Specifically, the broad questions that the company is trying to answer include:

**What are the factors that are associated with customers cancelling their reservation?**

**Is it possible to predict whether a customer will cancel their reservation? If so, how accurate are the predictions?**

**How many costly errors is the model expected to produce?**

**Are there any actions or policies the hotel can implement to reduce the risk of losing their reservations?**

**Approach**

**Data Exploration and Preprocessing:**

The dataset (bookings_df) contains information about over 5,000 hotel reservations, including customer demographics, booking details, and cancellation status.

Data cleaning and preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling were performed to ensure data readiness for modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify patterns, correlations, and factors associated with cancellations.

**Feature Engineering:**

Relevant features were selected based on domain knowledge and statistical analysis.

New features were derived to enhance model performance and provide better interpretability.

**Model Selection and Training:**

Various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, were trained and evaluated.

Hyperparameter tuning techniques such as grid search and cross-validation were applied to optimize model performance.

**Model Evaluation:**

Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC were used to assess the effectiveness of the models.

Feature importance analysis was conducted to understand the key factors influencing reservation cancellations.

**Deployment and Interpretation:**

The best-performing model was selected for potential deployment, providing actionable insights to hotel management.

Recommendations were made based on the findings to minimize cancellations and improve customer retention.

**Findings**

The analysis of hotel reservation cancellations reveals several key insights. Executive suites have the highest cancellation rate (50.9%), while studios have the lowest (33.8%), suggesting the need for tailored cancellation policies based on room type. Room rates and cancellations do not exhibit a strong correlation, indicating other influencing factors that require further investigation. Reservations with more specific requests tend to have higher cancellation rates, highlighting the importance of understanding guest preferences to reduce cancellations. Seasonal trends show that cancellations peak during high seasons and drop during low seasons, emphasizing the need for flexible staffing and booking policies. Additionally, meal plan selection affects cancellations, with "Modified American" meal plan customers showing higher cancellation rates, suggesting opportunities for the hotel to adjust offerings and incentives to promote lower-risk meal plans.

**Recommendations**

To reduce reservation cancellations and improve customer retention, the hotel should implement customized cancellation policies based on room types, offering incentives for Executive Suite bookings and adjusting policies for different accommodations. Dynamic pricing strategies should be employed, using historical cancellation data to optimize rates and provide special offers during peak seasons. Managing special requests by collecting customer feedback and enhancing services can help address guest needs and lower cancellations. Seasonal management plans should be developed to adjust staffing levels and optimize booking processes during high-demand periods. Additionally, offering incentives for meal plans with lower cancellation rates and aligning marketing strategies with customer preferences can further reduce cancellations and enhance overall satisfaction. Implementing these recommendations will enable the hotel to improve service quality, customer experience, and financial performance.
